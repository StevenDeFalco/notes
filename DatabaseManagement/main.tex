\section{Introduction}

\define{Database management systems (DBMS)} consist of \bold{data}, \bold{software} (programs such as data interfaces), and \bold{environments} (operating systems). DBMS contains information about a particular enterprise. They are collections of interrelated data, a set of programs to access the data, and an environment that is both \emph{convenient} and \emph{efficient} to use. The \emph{user} should only have to define what it is that they want from the database, whereas the \emph{database} is responsible for defining how this query can be fulfilled; relational databases are good at this. \\

Drawbacks to using \bold{file systems} to store data include the following: 

\begin{itemize}
  \item data \emph{redundancy} and \emph{inconsistency} (multiple formats, duplication of information, etc.)
  \item difficulties in \emph{accessing} data 
  \item data isolation (multiple files and formats) 
  \item concurrency issues (among multiple users)
  \item \emph{integrity} problems 
  \item atomicity of updates
  \item security problems (hard to provide varied levels of user access)
\end{itemize}

There are varying \define{levels of abstraction} in a database. The \define{physical level} defines how a record is stored. The \define{logical level} describes data stored in the database and the relationships among data. The \define{view level} is a way to hide details of data types and information for security purposes. \\ 

The \define{schema} is the logical structure of the database; this is analagous to type information of a variable in a program. \define{Physical schema} refer to database design at the physical level. \define{Logical schema} refer to database design at the logical level. An \define{instance} is the actual content of the database at a particular time; this is analagous to the value of a variable. \define{Physical data independence} is the ability to modify the physical schema without changing the logical schema. \\ 

\define{Data manipulation languages (DML)} are languages for accesing and manipulating the data organized in a DBMS. \define{Procedural languages} are ones in which the user specifies what data is required and how to get that data. \define{Declarative (nonprocedural) languages} are ones in which the user specifies what data is required without specifying how to get such data. \bold{SQL} is the most widely used query language. \\ 

A \define{data definition language (DDL)} is the specific notation for defining the database schema. The \define{DDL compiler} generates a set of tables stored in a data dictionary. Data dictionary contains metadata. \\ 

A \define{relational database} is based on the relational data model. Data and relationships among the data are represented by a collection of tables. These include both a \bold{DML} and \bold{DDL}. The most common relational database systems employ the \bold{SQL} query language.
