\section{Principles of Economics}

\define{Economics} is the study of how individuals make decision: how we produce, distribute, consume goods and services in a society where resources are scarce. The principles of economics are as follows: 
\begin{itemize}
  \item Choices are necessary because resources are scarce. 
    \begin{itemize}
      \item A \define{resource} is anything that can be used to produce something else. 
      \item A resource is \define{scarce} when there is not enough of the resource available to satisfy all the various ways a society wants to use it. 
    \end{itemize}
  \item The true cost of something is its \define{opporunity cost} (def: what you must give up in order to get something). 
  \item \emph{How much} is a decision at the margin (for each additional unit). 
    \begin{itemize}
      \item A \define{marginal decision} is a decision made at the margins of an acitvity about whether to do a bit more or a bit less of that activity 
      \item \define{Marginal analysis} is the study of margin decisions.
    \end{itemize}
  \item People respond to incentives (def: anything that offers rewards to people who change their behavior), exploiting opportunities to make themselves better off. 
\end{itemize}

\define{Trade} allows us to consume more than we otherwise could; gains from trade arise from specialization. \define{Specialization} is the situation in which each person specializes in the task that he or she is good at performing. The principles of the interaction of individual choices are as follows: 
\begin{itemize}
  \item There are gains from trade. 
  \item Markets (def: a place where a good or service is exchange) move toward equilibrium (def: an economic situation in which no individual would be better off doing something different)
\end{itemize}
