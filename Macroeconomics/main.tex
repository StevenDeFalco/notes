\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Basic Definitions}

\define{Scarcity} is a situation in which resources are limited and can be used in different ways, so we \emph{must sacrifice one thing for another}. \\ 

\define{Labor} is the primary source for providing goods and services. \\

\define{Opportunity cost} is what we give up when we make a choice or a decision. \\

\define{Economics} is the study of the choices made by people (\emph{individuals and societies}) who are faced with scarcity. The two major fields are microecnomics and macroeconomics. \emph{Microecnomics} studiees consumers and produces. \emph{Macroeconomics} studies the economy as a whole. \\ 

\subsubsection{Economic questions a society is faced with...}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item What will be produced? 
  \item How will it be produced?
  \item Who consumes the goods and services produced?
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Production Possibility Frontier (PPF)}

The \define{PPF} is a graph that shows all possible combinations of goods and services that can be produced if all resources used efficiently. This is a limit that cannot be exceeded; it represents the best case scenario (in terms of efficiency). 

\begin{example}
Consider two goods: defense goods and non-defense goods. With limited resources only certain combinations can be produced; these include the following:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item[A] 200 units of defense goods and 0 units of non-defense goods
    \item[B] 195 units of defense goods and 25 units of non-defense goods (opp. cost = 5)
    \item[C] 188 units of defense goods and 50 units of non-defense goods (opp. cost = 7) 
    \item[D] 175 units of defense goods and 75 units of non-defense goods (opp. cost = 13)
    \item[E] 155 units of defense goods and 100 units of non-defense goods (opp. cost = 20)
    \item[F] 125 units of defense goods and 125 units of non-defense goods (opp. cost = 30)
    \item[G] 75 units of defense goods and 150 units of non-defense goods (opp.cost = 50)
    \item[H] 0 units of defense goods and 160 units of non-defense goods (opp. cost = 75)
  \end{itemize}
\emph{Opportunity cost increases} as specialization in inputs to the labor must be given up. 
\end{example}

Graphically, the \define{PPF} represents the barrier between inefficient use of resources and unachievable levels of prdouction given the scenario. A coordinate under the PPF curve indicates under-utilization of resources A coordinate above the PPF is an impossible combination and, by definiton, unachievable. \\

The PPF can be shifted (in the positive direction) if there is an \emph{increase in resurces} or an \emph{improvement in technology}; this is called \define{economic growth}. \define{International trade} can help a nation move beyond their maximum capabilities in terms of consumption (exceed their PPF). 

\section{Demand and Supply Model}

\define{Firms} produce and supply their output to the \define{consumers} who demand the product. 

\subsection{Demand}

The quantity (Q) \define{demanded} is the amount of a good or service that consumers are willing and able to buy. Willingness and ability are the primary determinants of demand. Price of a product is the main determinant of our willingness and ability to purchase a product. \\ 

\bold{Determinants} of demand: 
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Price of the product (P) \\ 
    \begin{itemize}
      \item As the price of a product increases, the quantity of the product demanded decreases. \\ 
      \item As the price of a product decreases, the quantity of the product demanded increases. \\ 
      \item The \define{Law of Demand} is the negative relationship between price and quantity. 
    \end{itemize}
  \item Income (M)
    \begin{itemize}
      \item As income increases, the quantity of products demanded (typcially) increases. 
      \item As income decreases, the quantity of products demanded decreases. 
      \item For some products these relationships are the opposite. These products are considered \define{inferior goods}; such products are demanded more when income is lower due to the nature of the product (e.g. fast food or bus rides). 
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
